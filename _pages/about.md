Hello and welcome to my personal page üëã

Few things about me:
- Started developing on old ZX Spectrum at fourteen, mostly simple games.
  Found first freelance developer job when I was seventeen.
  I am thirty-three now, guess that makes it 16 years of commercial experience (as of 2023).
- I love learning programming languages.
  I developed in 15+ various languages, 10+ of them in production, mostly TypeScript, Python, C#, Java.
  [Elm](https://engineering.rakuten.today/post/elm-at-rakuten/) is my ‚ù§Ô∏è though.
- I specialize on a backend, but I have experience with web, native mobile, and desktop client development.
- For the last few years I'm involved in building and productizing ML, mostly NLP. I also did some computer vision in the past.
- Got enamoured with function programming recently.
- Self-motivated, work remotely for as long as I can remember.
- Generalist: curious to learn random facts from various disciplines.
- My other interests are: travelling, hiking, cooking, performing music, arthouse cinema, baroque music, linguistics.
