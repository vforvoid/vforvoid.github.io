Hello and welcome to my personal page üëã

Few things about me:
- I started developing simple games on old ZX Spectrum at around thirteen.
  Found first freelance developer job when I was seventeen.
  I am thirty-three now, which makes it ~16 years of commercial development experience (as of 2023).
- I **love** learning programming languages.
  I developed in [15+ various languages](./blog/2023/language-soup/) throughout my career, 10+ of which in production.
  I mostly wrote TypeScript, Python, C#, and Java.
  Elm is my ‚ù§Ô∏è though.
- I specialize in the backend, but I have experience with web, native mobile, and desktop client development.
- Over the last few years, I've built several ML-based solutions in natural language processing.
  I also did some computer vision in the past.
- I enjoy functional programming and value unit tests.
- Self-motivated, and work remotely for as long as I can remember.
- Generalist: curious to learn random facts from various disciplines.
- My slightly less technical interests are traveling, hiking, cooking, performing music, arthouse cinema, baroque music, and linguistics.
