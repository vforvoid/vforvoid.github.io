I would have likely ended up working in a semi-bankrupt factory and spending my evenings on the sofa drinking beer in front of the TV. However, my father surprised me on my twelfth birthday (it was 2012) with an old ZX Spectrum 48K, which turned out to be the best gift I ever received.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/walking-down-the-memory-lane/zx.png" width="100%" alt="Image of the old ZX Spectrum 48K computer that. Black keyboard mono-block computer. Rainbow diagonal strip in the bottom right corner. Each key has a bunch of commands written on top of them." title="ZX Spectrum 48K, mine was some export version of it and was white though"></p> <p>It was a machine that was released in 1982. It didn’t have any operating system at all, nor did it have a hard drive. All this computer had was a BASIC interpreter burnt into its read-only memory circuit and a very rudimentary code editor. You could use your TV as its screen, just like with a PlayStation. I also received a cassette tape with a dozen games and apps on it as a bonus. Yes, before floppy disks got popular, you were supposed to connect an audio tape player to the computer, rewind your cassette to the correct spot, type a command, and press play to start loading the data you wanted from persistent memory. Then, you had to wait for five minutes, enjoying the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y9V0yfO1T0" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">beeping sounds</a> that are very similar to those made by dial-up modems. 95% of the time, the app loaded successfully. Other 5% of the time, you had to rewind the tape and start over. I had a portable audiotape player, but it had a 3.5mm jack for headphones, while the computer had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_connector" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">5-pin DIN</a> audio outlet. So, to load the first games from the tape onto this beast, I had to make my first adapter by cutting and soldering two wires together.</p> <p>When I first set up the computer, I wanted to start loading and playing the games, but I didn’t know how to enter the command that would make the computer wait for the input data from the tape. Obviously, none of my relatives or friends knew how to use this relic of the machine either, so I was on my own. Fortunately, I found an old softcover book with a BASIC manual printed on cheap yellow paper which was included with the PC. I spent a few minutes looking for the “launching games” chapter, but it was not there. Disappointing, but totally expected. However, I thought to myself, “If there are games on the tape, there must be a way to load them, right? There’s no way this book doesn’t have this information. I gotta read it.”</p> <p>I began reading the first few chapters which covered variables, math operations, and printing out text. I experimented with basic math and variables and thought to myself, “Whoa! I can use this thing as a powerful calculator for my math homework!” I pressed on and read about conditions, cycles, and drawing shapes on the screen and went experimenting with this new knowledge. I became completely absorbed. I spent an entire day writing programs that drew bizarre ornaments made of lines and circles. “Draw circles in a for loop with the common center with the given step in a radius. That’s a bullseye! Draw 1000 circles in random coords with random radii. Oh cool, it kinda looks like ripples from the raindrops.” It was extra fascinating because drawing was noticeably slow on this machine: you could observe how computer is drawing lines pixel by pixel, so there was an impression that somebody methodically makes strokes with a brush. The next day, I eagerly read a chapter on sound output and using the built-in beeper. I discovered that I could give it a pitch and duration, and it would play sounds for me. I was learning to play a guitar around same time and I knew the basics of music theory, so I spent the entire day writing small tunes on this piece of plastic.</p> <p>And then I discovered the “User Input” chapter and started creating basic games. I believe the first game I ever made had about 20 lines of code. You press the space button, and it starts a random timer where “you act normal as if nothing is happening, living your usual life.” A few seconds later, it makes a beeping signal that notifies you that the giant volcano in the center of your room is about to erupt. It then starts a random duration “volcano eruption timer” that lasts for about 3 to 10 seconds. During that time period, you are supposed to pick up as many toys from the floor as you can and jump onto the bed. When the volcano timer runs out, the computer emits a long, nasty, high-pitched beep that means the floor has just turned into hot lava. If you get caught staying on the floor, you’re dead, gg wp. Otherwise, you get an amount of points equal to the number of toys you were able to “save from lava”. The collected toys are then thrown back on the ground, and a new round begins. Whoever gets more points in multiple rounds wins. How is this not an AR game 😄? Obviously, I wrote more complex and “traditional” video games later, but this one has a special place in my heart.</p> <p><img src="/assets/img/walking-down-the-memory-lane/volcano-room.png" width="100%" alt="Midjourney AI generated image. Prompt: Create a vibrant fable-inspired cartoon image depicting a cozy children's bedroom with two ten-year-old boys. The bed is situated towards the back of the room, and a shelf is to the left. In the center of the room, there is a 40-centimeter-tall volcano that is erupting, spewing lava that has already started to cover parts of the floor. The boys are in mid-air, jumping onto the bed while holding onto their favorite toys, which they are rescuing from the lava. Toys litter the ground of the room, and one of them has even caught fire from the heat. The boys' faces are filled with joy and laughter, as the volcanic eruption is all part of their imaginary game." title="The way we imagined it as a kids."></p> <p>And yes, I found out how to load and save programs to and from the tape. I even played a few <a href="https://youtu.be/lHAPELM3eCc?t=11" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">retro ZX games</a>, so I kinda got what I came for. But by this point, my brain had already been irreversibly damaged by programming. Playing games no longer held the same appeal for me. I was fascinated by the idea that I could control what the machine did: I simply gave it a list of instructions, and it obeyed them. It was absolutely mind-blowing and magical for me. It was infinitely cooler than my rich classmate’s remote-controlled car. I had a golem of plastic and silicon in my room that could process data and display it on the screen according to my instructions. I didn’t have to be in front of it all the time; I could automate the machine’s responses to various inputs and save the program for later use. It’s a mundane thing for me and everyone else now, but at that moment, it felt too good to be true.</p> <p>And that’s how I got into programming.</p> </article> <br> <hr> <br> <ul class="list-disc pl-8"></ul> <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-12">Enjoy Reading This Article?</h2> <p class="mb-2">Here are some more articles you might like to read next:</p> <li class="my-2"> <a class="text-pink-700 underline font-semibold hover:text-pink-800" href="/blog/2023/language-soup/">Programming language soup</a> </li> </div> </div> <footer class="sticky-bottom mt-5"> <div class="container"> © Copyright 2023 Vadim Polosatov. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.1/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha256-fgLAgv7fyCGopR/gBNq2iW3ZKIdqIcyshnUULC4vex8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@4/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.0.8/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-7PhEpEWEW0XXQ0k6kQrPKwuoIomz8R8IYyuU1Qew4P8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">window.MathJax={tex:{tags:"ams"}};</script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.0/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script> <script defer src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script> </body> </html>
